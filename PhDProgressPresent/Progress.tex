\section{Research Agenda}
\subsection{Animating Conjecture}
\begin{frame}
	Early contracting will  result from a matching process where there is lots of scope for strategy 
\end{frame}

\subsection{Pieces of this}
\subsubsection{Characterize early contracting}
\begin{frame}
	This is my ``Unraveling'' line of work
\end{frame}

\subsubsection{Characterize when matching games have `large' cores}
\begin{frame}
	This is my  most current work
\end{frame}

\subsubsection{Formally combine these ideas}
\begin{frame}
	This is ambitious--I'd like to say something in general about matching markets where the choice to participate is a strategic option.

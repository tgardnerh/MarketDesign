abstract = {This paper studies the role played by caste, education and other social and economic attributes in arranged marriages among middle-class Indians. We use a unique data set on individuals who placed matrimonial advertisements in a major newspaper, the responses they received, how they ranked them, and the eventual matches. We estimate the preferences for caste, education, beauty, and other attributes. We then compute a set of stable matches, which we compare to the actual matches that we observe in the data. We find the stable matches to be quite similar to the actual matches, suggesting a relatively frictionless marriage market. One of our key empirical findings is that there is a very strong preference for within-caste marriage. However, because both sides of the market share this preference and because the groups are fairly homogeneous in terms of the distribution of other attributes, in equilibrium, the cost of wanting to marry within-caste is low. This allows caste to remain a persistent feature of the Indian marriage market.},

@article{Bourgeois-Gironde2010,
abstract = {Regret helps to optimize decision behaviour. It can be defined as a rational emotion. Several recent neurobiological studies have confirmed the interface between emotion and cognition at which regret is located and documented its role in decision behaviour. These data give credibility to the incorporation of regret in decision theory that had been proposed by economists in the 1980s. However, finer distinctions are required in order to get a better grasp of how regret and behaviour influence each other. Regret can be defined as a predictive error signal but this signal does not necessarily transpose into a decision-weight influencing behaviour. Clinical studies on several types of patients show that the processing of an error signal and its influence on subsequent behaviour can be dissociated. We propose a general understanding of how regret and decision-making are connected in terms of regret being modulated by rational antecedents of choice. Regret and the modification of behaviour on its basis will depend on the criteria of rationality involved in decision-making. We indicate current and prospective lines of research in order to refine our views on how regret contributes to optimal decision-making.},

The experiment on screening of Iranian wheat landraces for micronutrient deficiency was carried out. Method was performed for devising an efficient system for screening of Iranian wheat landraces for tolerance to micronutrient deficiency. A set of 202 Iranian wheat landraces along with checks (PBW 621, HD 2967, HD 3086, WH 1105, PDW 291 and TL 2908) were used. The experiment was carried out in glasses using sand culture. Seeds were cut from middle and embryo part was used for germination studies. Murashige and Skoog (MS) macro-salts nutrient solution was used to create micronutrient deficiency for 40 days. The observations on root and shoot length, fresh and dry weight were recorded after 40 days. The result based on frequency distribution was found to be approximately normal for all seedling traits under micronutrient deficiency. Genotype IR175 had maximum seedling length (72 cm) and minimum seedling length was recorded in IR187 (17 cm). Maximum seedling fresh weight was recorded in genotype IR26 (3.73 g) and IR125 was recorded minimum seedling fresh weight (0.12 g). Genotype IR26 had maximum seedling dry weight (0.60 g) and IR97 was recorded minimum seedling dry weight (0.04 g). Iranian landraces i.e. IR26, IR55, IR83, IR30, IR13, IR40, IR191, IR20, IR4, IR16 were found to be the best landraces tolerant to micronutrient deficiency on the basis of seedling dry weight.},

Our results demonstrate that in large, uniform markets using the Men-Proposing Deferred Acceptance Algorithm, each woman's best response to truthful behavior by all other agents is to truncate her list substantially. In fact, the optimal degree of truncation for such a woman goes to 100{\%} of her list as the market size grows large. In general one-to-one markets we provide comparative statics for optimal truncation strategies: reduction in risk aversion and reduced correlation across preferences each lead agents to truncate more. So while several recent papers focused on the limits of strategic manipulation, our results serve as a reminder that without pre-conditions ensuring truthful reporting, there exists a potential for significant manipulation even in settings where agents have little information.},

We adopt the trade-off method and show that it is robust to violations of transitivity. Our method makes no assumptions about the shape of the functions reflecting utility and regret. It can be performed at the individual level, taking account of preference heterogeneity. Our data support the main assumption of regret theory, that people are disproportionately averse to large regrets, even when event-splitting effects are controlled for. The findings are robust: similar results were obtained in two measurements using different stimuli. The data support the reliability of the trade-off method: its measurements could be replicated using different stimuli and were not susceptible to strategic responding. {\textcopyright} 2010 INFORMS.},

The model departs from the standard Gale and Shapley (1962) model by assuming that a finite number of agents on one side (colleges or firms) are matched to a continuum mass of agents on the other side (students or workers). We show that stable matchings correspond to solutions of supply and demand equations, with the selectivity of each college playing a role similar to prices.  We apply the model to an analysis of how competition induced by school choice gives schools incentives to invest in different aspects of quality.

Linear theory obtains a linear function u on a set P of probability measures for which u(p) {\textgreater} u(q) if and only if p is preferred to q. The new theory obtains a skew-symmetric bilinear function $\phi$ on P × P for which $\phi$(p, q) {\textgreater} 0 if and only if p is preferred to q.

The Allais Paradox represents one of the earliest empirical challenges to normative models of decision-making, and suggests that choices in one part of a gamble may depend on the possible outcome in another, independent, part of the gamble-a violation of the so-called "independence axiom." To account for Allaisian behavior, one well-known class of models propose that individuals' choices are influenced not only by possible outcomes resulting from one's choices, but also the anticipation of regret for foregone options. Here we test the regret hypothesis using a population of patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a clinical population known to present ventromedial prefrontal cortex dysfunctions and associated with impaired regret processing in previous studies of decision-making. Compared to matched controls and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, we found a striking diminution of Allaisian behavior among bvFTD patients. These results are consistent with the regret hypothesis and furthermore suggest a crucial role for prefrontal regions in choices that typically stands in contradiction with a basic axiom of rational decision-making.},

abstract = {In the early 1900s, competition among hospitals for interns and among medical students for good internships led to increasingly early offers of internships to students. By the 1940s, appointments were often made as early as the beginning of the junior year of medical school. Hospitals thus had little information about students' performance, and students frequently had to make a final decision to accept or reject an offer without knowing which other offers might be forthcoming. From 1945 through 1951, efforts were made to enforce a uniform date for accepting offers. However, students were still faced with offers having very short deadlines, compelling them to accept or reject offers without knowing what other offers might be forthcoming. Hospitals often had to scramble for available students, since if an offer was rejected, it was often too late for them to reach their next preferred candidate. A centralized clearinghouse was thus developed as a way of alleviating this chaos and allowing a larger role to the preferences of both students and hospitals. This evolved into the current matching program, whose algorithm continues to be updated to take account of changing needs of applicants, such as growth in the number of couples who seek 2 positions in the same vicinity.},

abstract = {In Fall 2009, Chicago authorities abandoned a school assignment mechanism midstream, citing concerns about its vulnerability to manipulation. Nonetheless, they asked thousands of applicants to re-rank schools in a new mechanism that is also manipulable. This paper introduces a method to compare mechanisms by their vulnerability to manipulation. Our methodology formalizes how the old mechanism is at least as manipulable as any other plausible mechanism, including the new one. A number of similar transitions took place in England after the widely popular Boston mechanism was ruled illegal in 2007. Our approach provides support for these and other recent policy changes.

abstract = {The movement of blacks from the status of a slave to that of a consumer had tremendous social and geographic consequences. Slaves were not possessors of money and did not engage in the commodity circuit. Emancipation elevated blacks to wage laborers and consumers. The commodity circuit produced social relations that were problematic for race relations in the postbellum South. The geographical and social solution to this problem was neither integration nor exclusion of blacks from the commodity circuit, but segregation. While the model of consumption may be white, the way of capitalism is not to deny anyone access to the commodity circuit. Exclusion would have provided too rigid a boundary for the commodity circuit. The Plessy decision satisfied the structural imperative of capital to expand consumption while also retaining race as a social marker. It provided for the right amount of inclusion and exclusion in the commodity circuit, reducing just enough of the racial obstacle to expand the sphere of consumption to include the former slaves.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Medicare cost reports (MCR), Internal Revenue Service form 990s (IRS 990), and audited financial statements (AFS) vary in their content, detail, purpose, timeliness, and certification. The purpose of this study was to compare selected financial data elements and characterize the extent of differences in financial data and ratios across the MCR, IRS 990, and AFS for a sample of nonprofit critical access hospitals (CAHs).

METHODS: Line items from AFS of 47 CAHs were compared to data reported in the hospitals' MCR and IRS 990s. Line items were based on 9 financial indicators commonly used to assess hospital financial performance.

FINDINGS: Of the indicators examined, the equity financing ratio most frequently matched between the 3 reports, while salaries and benefits to total expenses and debt service coverage were often different. Variances were driven by differences in individual account balances used to construct the ratios. Relative to AFS, cash was frequently lower on the IRS 990 while marketable securities and unrestricted investments were often higher. Other revenue and net income were consistently lower on the MCR and IRS 990, and depreciation was often higher on the MCR. The majority of total assets and fund balance (equity) values matched across the 3 reports, suggesting differences in classification among detailed accounts were more common than variances between the component totals (total assets, total liabilities, and fund balance).

CONCLUSIONS: Health policy researchers should consider the impact of these variances on study results and consider ways to improve the availability and quality of financial accounting information.},

abstract = {Researchers and policy makers are often interested in estimating how treatments or policy interventions affect the outcomes of those most in need of help. This concern has motivated the increasingly common practice of disaggregating experimental data by groups constructed on the basis of an index of baseline characteristics that predicts the values that individual outcomes would take on in the absence of the treatment. This article shows that substantial biases may arise in practice if the index is estimated, as is often the case, by regressing the outcome variable on baseline characteristics for the full sample of experimental controls. We analyze the behavior of leave-one-out and repeated split sample estimators and show that in realistic scenarios they have substantially lower biases than the full sample estimator. We use data from the National JTPA Study and the Tennessee STAR experiment to demonstrate the performance of alternative estimators and the magnitude of their biases.},

@article{Kane2001,
abstract = {Health policy makers, legislators, providers, payers, and a broad range of other players in the health care market routinely seek information on hospital financial performance. Yet the data at their disposal are limited, especially since hospitals' audited financial statements--the "gold standard" in hospital financial reporting --are not publicly available in many states. As a result, the Medicare Cost Report (MCR), filed annually by most U.S. hospitals in order to receive payment for treating Medicare patients, has become the primary public source of hospital financial information. However, financial accounting elements in the MCR are unreliable, poorly defined, and lacking in critical detail. Comparative analyses of MCRs and matched, audited financial statements reveal long-standing problems with the MCR's data, including major differences in reported profits; variations in the reporting of both revenues and expenses; an absence of relevant details, such as charity care, bad debt, operating versus nonoperating income, and affiliate transactions; an inconsistent classification of changes in net assets; and a failure to provide cash flow statements. Because of these problems, MCR financial data give only a limited and often inaccurate picture of the financial position of hospitals. Audited financial statements provide a more complete perspective, enabling analysts to address important questions left unanswered by the MCR data. Regulatory action is needed to create a national database of financial information based upon audited statements.},

More promising agents may contract early with each other because insurance gains outweigh sorting inefficiency, whereas less promising agents wait. It can also happen in equilibrium that more promising job applicants contract early with less promising firms. Such worker-driven equilibria may arise when applicants are more risk-averse, have greater uncertainty regarding their quality, or face a tighter market and when production exhibits increasing returns to firms' qualities. Early contracting then unambiguously hurts the more promising firms that choose to wait.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blacks are less likely than whites to receive coronary revascularization and evidence-based therapies after acute myocardial infarction, yet the impact of these differences on long-term outcomes is unknown.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We linked Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines (CRUSADE) registry data to national Medicare claims, creating a longitudinal record of care and outcomes among 40 500 patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction treated at 446 hospitals to examine mortality and readmission rates (mean follow-up, 2.4 years) among black and white patients. Relative to whites (n=37 384), blacks (n=3116) were more often younger and female; more often had diabetes mellitus and renal failure; and received less aggressive interventions, including cardiac catheterization (60.7{\%} versus 54.0{\%}; P{\textless}0.001), percutaneous coronary intervention (32.1{\%} versus 23.8{\%}; P{\textless}0.001), and coronary bypass surgery (9.2{\%} versus 5.7{\%}; P{\textless}0.001). Although blacks had lower 30-day mortality (9.1{\%} versus 9.9{\%}; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.71-0.92), they had higher observed mortality at 1 year (27.9{\%} versus 24.5{\%}; P{\textless}0.001), although this was not significant after adjustment on long-term follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.94-1.07). Black patients also had higher 30-day (23.6{\%} versus 20.0{\%}; P{\textless}0.001) and 1-year (62.0{\%} versus 54.6{\%}; P{\textless}0.001) all-cause readmission, but these differences were no longer significant after risk adjustment on 30-day (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.92-1.13) and long-term (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.00-1.11) follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS: Although older blacks with an acute myocardial infarction had lower initial mortality rates than whites, this early survival advantage did not persist during long-term follow-up. The reasons for this are multifactorial but may include differences in comorbidities and postdischarge care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) have been shown to dramatically reduce the risk of angiographic and clinical restenosis compared with bare metal stent (BMS) implantation. However, the overall cost-effectiveness of this strategy is unknown.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Between February and August 2001, 1058 patients with complex coronary stenoses were enrolled in the SIRIUS trial and randomized to percutaneous coronary revascularization with either a SES or BMS. Clinical outcomes, resource use, and costs were assessed prospectively for all patients over a 1-year follow-up period. Initial hospital costs were increased by 2881 dollars per patient with SESs. Over the 1-year follow-up period, use of SESs led to substantial reductions in the need for repeat revascularization, including repeat percutaneous coronary intervention and bypass surgery. Although follow-up costs were reduced by 2571 dollars per patient with SESs, aggregate 1-year costs remained 309 dollars per patient higher. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for SES was 1650 dollars per repeat revascularization event avoided or 27,540 dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained, values that compare reasonably with other accepted medical interventions. Under updated treatment assumptions regarding available stent lengths and duration of antiplatelet therapy, use of SESs was projected to reduce total 1-year costs compared with BMSs.

CONCLUSIONS: Although use of SESs was not cost-saving compared with BMS implantation, for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention of complex coronary stenoses, their use appears to be reasonably cost-effective within the context of the US healthcare system.},

abstract = {Many centralized two-sided markets form a matching between participants by running a stable marriage algorithm. It is a well-known fact that no matching mechanism based on a stable marriage algorithm can guarantee truthfulness as a dominant strategy for participants. However, as we will show in this paper, in a probabilistic setting where the preference lists of one side of the market are composed of only a constant (independent of the the size of the market) number of entries, each drawn from an arbitrary distribution, the number of participants that have more than one stable partner is vanishingly small. This proves (and generalizes) a conjecture of Roth and Peranson [23]. As a corollary of this result, we show that, with high probability, the truthful strategy is the best response for a given player when the other players are truthful. We also analyze equilibria of the deferred acceptance stable marriage game. We show that the game with complete information has an equilibrium in which a (1 - o(1)) fraction of the strategies are truthful in expectation. In the more realistic setting of afile:///Users/tylerhoppenfeld/Downloads/p53-immorlica.pdf game of incomplete information, we will show that the set of truthful strategies form a (1 + o(1))-approximate Bayesian-Nash equilibrium. Our results have implications in many practical settings and were inspired by the work of Roth and Peranson [23] on the National Residency Matching Program.},

abstract = {In Switzerland, the annual circulation taxes on road vehicles are set by and paid to the cantons (not to the federal government). We exploit the 26 different circulation tax rules and their variation over time, which we interpret as a natural experiment, to see if linking them to a vehicle's CO2 emissions rate has helped shift new car sales towards lower-emitting vehicles. We find that even when the penalty associated with a highly polluting vehicle is high, the effect is relatively small. For example, in canton Zurich, imposing a 50{\%} "malus" on the annual registration fee for cars that emit 200 or more grams of CO2 per kilometer reduces the average CO2 emissions rate from new cars by only 0.46g per kilometer, bringing it to 158.11g per kilometer in 2011. A similar effect would be attained with a modest increase in fuel taxes. Bonus policies may trigger new car sales and engender a net increase in CO2 emissions.},

abstract = {This essay discusses the effect of technical change on wage inequality. I argue that the behavior of wages and returns to schooling indicates that technical change has been skill-biased during the past sixty years. Furthermore, the recent increase in inequality is most likely due to an acceleration in skill bias. In contrast to twentieth century developments, most technical change during the nineteenth century appears to be skill-replacing. I suggest that this is because the increased supply of unskilled workers in the English cities made the introduction of these technologies profitable. On the other hand, the twentieth-century has been characterized by skill-biased technical change because the rapid increase in the supply of skilled workers has induced the development of skill-complementary technologies. The recent acceleration in skill bias is in turn likely to have been a response to the acceleration in the supply of skills during the past several decades.},

We examine the effects of the introduction of the secret ballot in Chile in 1958 on voting behavior. Before the reforms, localities with more pervasive patron-client relationships tended to exhibit a much stronger support for the right-wing parties, traditionally associ- ated with the landed oligarchy. After the reform, however, this difference across localities completely disappeared. (JEL},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A comparison of federal Medicare databases to identify critical care medicine (CCM) use, cost discrepancies, and their possible causes.

DESIGN: A 6-yr (1995-2000) retrospective analysis of Medicare hospital and CCM use and cost, comparing the Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) with Medicare Provider Analysis and Review File (MedPAR) supplemented when necessary by Health Care Information System (HCIS) (identified herein as MedPAR/HCIS).

SETTING: All nonfederal U.S. hospitals.

SUBJECTS: None.

INTERVENTIONS: None.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data are presented as days (M = million) and costs ({\$}; B = Billion) for both hospitals and CCM. Between 1995 and 2000, the number of hospital days decreased in both databases: HCRIS (-13.2{\%}; 78M to 67.7M) and MedPAR/HCIS (-14.1{\%}; 82.8M to 71.1M). CCM days decreased in HCRIS (-4.6{\%}; 8.3M to 7.9M). In contrast, CCM days increased in MedPAR/HCIS (7.2{\%}; 13.9M to 14.9M). The discrepancy in CCM days between HCRIS and MedPAR/HCIS increased from 40{\%} (5.6M days) in 1995 to 47{\%} (7M days) in 2000. Two CCM billing codes (intensive care unit and coronary care unit "post/intermediate") used in MedPAR/HCIS were responsible for 73{\%} on average per year, over the study period, for this CCM discrepancy. The use of these two codes progressively increased (44{\%}; 3.9M to 5.6M days) by the end of the study. The cumulative 6-yr discrepancy in CCM days between HCRIS and MedPAR/HCIS (37.3M days) had a calculated cost of {\$}92.3B.

CONCLUSIONS: We have identified major, and progressively increasing, discrepancies between two U.S. federal databases tabulating hospital and CCM use and cost for Medicare beneficiaries. Two CCM "post/intermediate" billing codes in MedPAR/HCIS were predominantly responsible for the CCM discrepancy. To accurately assess Medicare CCM use and cost, either HCRIS, or MedPAR/HCIS without the "post/intermediate" codes, should be used.},

Unequal Treatment offers recommendations for improvements in medical care financing, allocation of care, availability of language translation, community-based care, and other arenas.

Our estimates of unexplained race premia are smaller than previous estimates in the literature. Online, we find that minority buyers pay nearly the same prices as do whites controlling for consumers' income, education, and neighborhood characteristics. These results are consistent with the Internet facilitating information search and removing cues to a consumer's willingness to pay. Our results imply that the Internet is particularly beneficial to those whose characteristics disadvantage them in negotiating.},

Paternalism reduced monitoring and turnover costs in cotton cultivation in the U.S. South until the mechanization of the cotton harvest in the 1950's. Until then, the effectiveness of paternalism was threatened by government programs that could have substituted for paternalism; but large Southern landowners had the political power to prevent the appearance of such programs in the South. With mechanization, the economic incentive to provide paternalism disappeared, and Southern congressmen allowed welfare programs to expand in ways consistent with their interests.

abstract = {This paper surveys the recent literature on the causal relationship between education and earnings. I focus on four areas of work: theoretical and econometric advances in modelling the causal effect of education in the presence of heterogeneous returns to schooling; recent studies that use institutional aspects of the education system to form instrnmental variables estimates of the return to schooling; recent studies of the earnings and schooling of twins; and recent attempts to explicitly model sources of heterogeneity in the returns to education. Consistent with earlier surveys of the literature, I conclude that the average (or average marginal) return to education is not much below the estimate that emerges from a standard human capital earnings function fit by OLS. Evidence from the latest studies of identical twins suggests a small upward "ability" bias - on the order of 10{\%}. A consistent finding among studies using instrnmental variables based on institutional changes in the education system is that the estimated returns to schooling are 20-40{\%} above the corresponding OLS esti- mates. Part of the explanation for this finding may be that marginal returns to schooling for certain subgroups - particularly relatively disadvantaged groups with low education outcomes - are higher than the average marginal returns to education in the population as a whole.},

@article{Baicker2012,
abstract = {There is growing concern over the rising share of the US economy devoted to health care spending. Fueled in part by demographic transitions, unchecked increases in entitlement spending will necessitate some combination of substantial tax increases, elimination of other public spending, or unsustainable public debt. This massive increase in health spending might be warranted if each dollar devoted to the health care sector yielded real health benefits, but this does not seem to be the case. Although we have seen remarkable gains in life expectancy and functioning over the past several decades, there is substantial variation in the health benefits associated with different types of spending. Some treatments, such as aspirin, beta blockers, and flu shots, produce a large health benefit per dollar spent. Other more expensive treatments, such as stents for cardiovascular disease, are high value for some patients but poor value for others. Finally, a large and expanding set of treatments, such as proton-beam therapy or robotic surgery, contributes to rapid increases in spending despite questionable health benefits. Moving resources toward more productive uses requires encouraging providers to deliver and patients to consume high-value care, a daunting task in the current political landscape. But widespread inefficiency also offers hope: Given the current distribution of resources in the US health care system, there is tremendous potential to improve the productivity of health care spending and the fiscal health of the United States.},

Although such preferences are known to jeopardize stability in a finite market, we show that a stable matching exists in a large market with a continuum of workers, provided that each firm's choice is convex and changes continuously as the set of available workers changes. We also study the existence and structure of stable matchings under preferences exhibiting substitutability and indifferences in a large market. Building on these results, we show that an approximately stable matching exists in large finite economies. We extend our framework to ensure a stable matching with desirable incentive and fairness properties in the presence of indifferences in firms' preferences.},

abstract = {Both obesity and breast cancer incidence increased dramatically during two recent decades in a rapidly changing society in northern Iran. In this study, we examined the ability of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) as predictor biomarkers of breast cancer risk in Iranian women. In a case-control study of 100 new cases of histological confirmed breast cancer and 200 age-matched controls, in Babol, we measured weight, height, waist and hip circumference at time of diagnosis with standard methods. The data of demographic, characteristics, reproductive and lifestyle factors were collected by interview. We used both regression and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis to estimate the predictive ability of BMI and WC for breast cancer as estimated by area under the curve (AUC). The results showed a significant difference in the mean of weight, BMI and WC between patients and controls in pre- and postmenopausal women (P{\textless}0.001). While after adjusting for BMI, no longer an association between WC and breast cancer was found. The overall accuracy of observed BMI and WC were 0.79 (95{\%} CI: 0.74-0.84) and 0.68 (95{\%} CI: 0.61-0.74), respectively. The accuracy of BMI and WC were 0.82 (95{\%} CI: 0.76-0.89), 0.75(0.67-0.83) for premenopausal and 0.77(0.68-0.85), 0.60 (0.50-0.71) for postmenopausal women, respectively. BMI and WC are predictor biomarkers of breast cancer risk in both pre- and postmenopausal Iranian women while after adjusting for BMI, no longer an association between WC and breast cancer was observed. These findings imply to perform breast cancer screening program in women with a higher BMI and WC.},

abstract = {Recent research argues that among former New World colonies a nation's past dependence on slave labor was important for its subse- quent economic development (Engerman and Sokoloff, 1997, 2002). It is argued that specialization in plantation agriculture, with its use of slave labor, caused economic inequality, which concentrated power in the hands of a small elite, adversely affecting the development of do- mestic institutions needed for sustained economic growth. I test for these relationships looking across former New World economies and across states and counties within the U.S. The data shows that slave use is negatively correlated with subsequent economic development. However, there is no evidence that this relationship is driven by large scale plantation slavery, or that the relationship works through slav- ery's effect on economic inequality.},

abstract = {Background Racial disparities in access to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are well documented. Recent evidence shows that even when patients receive CABG surgery, racial minorities are more likely to be treated by lower quality providers. Methods New York State (NYS) hospital discharge data for 1996 and 1997 for patients undergoing CABG surgery were combined with risk-adjusted mortality rates for cardiac surgeons calculated by the NYS Department of Health. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the relationship between patients' race and the quality of the surgeon performing the CABG, as measured by the surgeon's risk-adjusted mortality rate, after controlling for patient characteristics such as comorbidities and socioeconomic status; the hospital where the surgery was performed; and the number of surgeries the surgeon performed over a 3-year period. Results African Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders are treated by surgeons with higher risk-adjusted mortality rates compared with whites. This association does not appear to be a result of inadequate risk adjustment. It is explained to some degree by the hospital to which these patients are admitted, and to a lesser degree by (1) the education and income level in the patient's zipcode of residence and (2) being treated by a low-volume surgeon. After controlling for these factors, race continues to be associated with treatment by a surgeon with a higher risk-adjusted mortality rate. Conclusions Efforts to achieve the "Healthy People 2010" goals of eliminating health disparities should address not only access to care, but also access to high-quality care. ?? 2004 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of hospital system membership on negotiations between hospitals and managed care organizations (MCOs). Previous research finds that system hospitals secure higher reimbursements by exploiting local market concentration. By leveraging system membership in the bargaining game, however, system hospitals may also extract a higher percentage of their value to an MCO. Our findings reveal that more of the observed price gap between system and non-system hospitals can be attributed to bargaining power differences than to differences linked to relative concentration. These results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling the bargaining process when evaluating negotiated-price markets more generally.},

abstract = {Theories of the state are unable to explain                   intrastate variation in policy implementation                   because they tend to focus on the highest levels of                   the state hierarchy and ignore local-state                   institutions. Race-relations theories ignore the                   state entirely. This research views the local state                   as constrained by the superordinate national state                   and by local class structures. The racial nature of                   the local state, here termed the racial state, was                   designed and defended by plantation operators and                   white farm owners. Institutional features of the                   racial state conformed to the interests of planters                   and white farmers. These two classes also impeded                   the national state's dismantling of the racial state                   during the 1960s. Racial differences in                   enfranchisement were closely articulated with the                   local class structures typical of labor-intensive                   cotton agriculture rather than with competition and                   status variables suggested by race-relations                   theories.},

abstract = {The movement of blacks from the status of a slave to that of a consumer had tremendous social and geographic consequences. Slaves were not possessors of money and did not engage in the commodity circuit. Emancipation elevated blacks to wage laborers and consumers. The commodity circuit produced social relations that were problematic for race relations in the postbellum South. The geographical and social solution to this problem was neither integration nor exclusion of blacks from the commodity circuit, but segregation. While the model of consumption may be white, the way of capitalism is not to deny anyone access to the commodity circuit. Exclusion would have provided too rigid a boundary for the commodity circuit. The Plessy decision satisfied the structural imperative of capital to expand consumption while also retaining race as a social marker. It provided for the right amount of inclusion and exclusion in the commodity circuit, reducing just enough of the racial obstacle to expand the sphere of consumption to include the former slaves.},

abstract = {Themajority of labor transactions throughout much of history and a significant frac- tion of such transactions in many developing countries today are “coercive,” in the sense that force or the threat of force plays a central role in convincing workers to accept employment or its terms.We propose a tractable principal–agent model of co- ercion, based on the idea that coercive activities by employers, or “guns,” affect the participation constraint of workers.We show that coercion and effort are complements, so that coercion increases effort, but coercion always reduces utilitarian social welfare. Better outside options for workers reduce coercion because of the complementarity between coercion and effort: workers with a better outside option exert lower effort in equilibrium and thus are coerced less. Greater demand for labor increases coercion because it increases equilibrium effort. We investigate the interaction between out- side options, market prices, and other economic variables by embedding the (coercive) principal–agent relationship in a general equilibrium setup, and studying when and how labor scarcity encourages coercion. General (market) equilibrium interactions working through the price of output lead to a positive relationship between labor scarcity and coercion along the lines of ideas suggested by Domar, while interactions those working through the outside option lead to a negative relationship similar to ideas advanced in neo-Malthusian historical analyses of the decline of feudalism. In net, a decline in available labor increases coercion in general equilibrium if and only if its direct (partial equilibrium) effect is to increase the price of output by more than it increases outside options. Our model also suggests that markets in slaves make slaves worse off, condi- tional on enslavement, and that coercion is more viable in industries that do not require relationship-specific investment by workers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: African Americans are more likely to be seen by physicians with less clinical training or to be treated at hospitals with longer average times to acute reperfusion therapies. Less is known about differences in health outcomes. This report compares risk-adjusted mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) between US hospitals with high and low fractions of elderly black AMI patients.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective cohort study was performed for fee-for-service Medicare patients hospitalized for AMI during 1997 to 2001 (n=1,136,736). Hospitals (n=4289) were classified into approximate deciles depending on the extent to which the hospital served the black population. Decile 1 (12.5{\%} of AMI patients) included hospitals without any black AMI admissions during 1997 to 2001. Decile 10 (10{\%} of AMI patients) included hospitals with the highest fraction of black AMI patients (33.6{\%}). The main outcome measures were 90-day and 30-day mortality after AMI. Patients admitted to hospitals disproportionately serving blacks experienced no greater level of morbidities or severity of the infarction, yet hospitals in decile 10 experienced a risk-adjusted 90-day mortality rate of 23.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 23.2{\%} to 24.2{\%}) compared with 20.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 19.7{\%} to 20.4{\%}) in decile 1 hospitals. Differences in outcomes between hospitals were not explained by income, hospital ownership status, hospital volume, census region, urban status, or hospital surgical treatment intensity.

CONCLUSIONS: Risk-adjusted mortality after AMI is significantly higher in US hospitals that disproportionately serve blacks. A reduction in overall mortality at these hospitals could dramatically reduce black-white disparities in healthcare outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the association of race and outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery while controlling for both patient and hospital effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed data on a cohort of 566,785 white and 24,354 black Medicare beneficiaries 65 years old and older undergoing CABG in 1091 US hospitals from 1997 to 2000. Mortality and repeat revascularization rates were examined after sequential adjustment for patient and hospital differences by use of generalized estimating equations. Unadjusted mortality was higher (P{\textless}0.001) in black than in white patients at 30 (6.4{\%} versus 5.2{\%}), 90 (8.3{\%} versus 6.6{\%}), and 365 days (13.5{\%} versus 9.8{\%}) after surgery. Black patients were more likely (P{\textless}0.001) to undergo CABG at hospitals with the highest mortality (56{\%} versus 47{\%}) and at hospitals in the lowest volume quintile (24{\%} versus 20{\%}). Adjusted only for patient characteristics, mortality was 8{\%}, 11{\%}, and 25{\%} higher in black patients at 30, 90, and 365 days. After adjustment for hospital effects, 30 and 90 day mortality was similar but 17{\%} higher in black patients at 365 days. Racial differences in mortality were greater in men than in women. On adjustment for patient and hospital effects, repeat revascularization rates were similar in black and white patients. CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities in CABG outcomes are sensitive to the effects of sex and duration of postsurgical follow-up. The increasing disparity in outcomes as follow-up increased is consistent with the hypothesis that black patients have less access to secondary prevention and rehabilitation services after surgery.},

We apply the insights of our theory to the study of subsidies for green goods, specifically hybrid electric vehicles in Canada. We utilize highly detailed transaction data and leverage panel variation in subsidies across provinces for identification. Our baseline estimate finds that prices rises by {\$}575 for every {\$}1,000 increase in the subsidy. But, this pass-through estimate substantially underestimates consumer gains because a majority of this price increase is due to increased product quality in the form of additional options and features.

This essay reviews the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of this work and documents the success of Goldin and Katz's framework in accounting for numerous broad labor market trends. The essay also considers areas where the framework falls short in explaining several key labor market puzzles of recent decades and argues that these shortcomings can potentially be overcome by relaxing the implicit equivalence drawn between workers' skills and their job tasks in the conceptual framework on which Goldin and Katz build. The essay argues that allowing for ­­a richer set of interactions between skills and technologies in accomplishing job tasks both augments and refines the predictions of Goldin and Katz's approach and suggests an even more important role for human capital in economic growth than indicated by their analysis.

Studies of early data found that blacks received care that was of lower quality than that received by whites. In this study, we assessed changes over time in the overall quality of care and in the magnitude of racial disparities in nine measures of clinical performance. METHODS: In order to compare the quality of care for elderly white and black beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare managed-care plans who were eligible for at least one of nine HEDIS measures, we analyzed 1.8 million individual-level observations from 183 health plans from 1997 to 2003. For each measure, we assessed whether the magnitude of the racial disparity had changed over time with the use of multivariable models that adjusted for the age, sex, health plan, Medicaid eligibility, and socioeconomic position of beneficiaries on the basis of their area of residence. RESULTS: During the seven-year study period, clinical performance improved on all measures for both white enrollees and black enrollees (P{\textless}0.001). The gap between white beneficiaries and black beneficiaries narrowed for seven HEDIS measures (P{\textless}0.01). However, racial disparities did not decrease for glucose control among patients with diabetes (increasing from 4 percent to 7 percent, P{\textless}0.001) or for cholesterol control among patients with cardiovascular disorders (increasing from 14 percent to 17 percent; change not significant, P=0.72). CONCLUSIONS: The measured quality of care for elderly Medicare beneficiaries in managed-care plans improved substantially from 1997 to 2003. Racial disparities declined for most, but not all, HEDIS measures we studied. Future research should examine factors that contributed to the narrowing of racial disparities on some measures and focus on interventions to eliminate persistent disparities in the quality of care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are large variations in the use of knee arthroplasty among Medicare enrollees according to race or ethnic group and sex. Are racial and ethnic disparities more pronounced in some regions than in others, and if so, why?

METHODS: We used all Medicare fee-for-service claims data for 1998 through 2000 to determine the incidence of knee arthroplasty according to Hospital Referral Region, sex, and race or ethnic group. A total of 430,726 knee arthroplasties were performed during the three-year study period.

RESULTS: At the national level, the annual rate of knee arthroplasty was higher for non-Hispanic white women (5.97 procedures per 1000) than for Hispanic women (5.37 per 1000) and black women (4.84 per 1000). The rate for non-Hispanic white men (4.82 procedures per 1000) was higher than that for Hispanic men (3.46 per 1000) and more than double that for black men (1.84 per 1000). The rates were significantly lower for black men than for non-Hispanic white men in nearly every region of the country (P{\textless}0.05). For the Hispanic population and for black women, racial or ethnic disparities at the national level were due in part to geographic differences rather than to differences in the rates for different racial and ethnic groups within geographic areas. Residential segregation and low income levels contributed to racial and ethnic disparities in arthroplasty rates.

CONCLUSIONS: In the Medicare population, the rate of surgical treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee varies dramatically according to sex, race or ethnic group, and region. These variations underscore the importance of geography and sex in determining racial or ethnic barriers to health care.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Nonwhite patients experience significantly longer times to fibrinolytic therapy (door-to-drug times) and percutaneous coronary intervention (door-to-balloon times) than white patients, raising concerns of health care disparities, but the reasons for these patterns are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To estimate race/ethnicity differences in door-to-drug and door-to-balloon times for patients receiving primary reperfusion for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; to examine how sociodemographic factors, insurance status, clinical characteristics, and hospital features mediate racial/ethnic differences. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective, observational study using admission and treatment data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI) for a US cohort of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or left bundle-branch block and receiving reperfusion therapy. Patients (73,032 receiving fibrinolytic therapy; 37,143 receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention) were admitted from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2002, to hospitals participating in NRMI 3 and 4. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Minutes between hospital arrival and acute reperfusion therapy. RESULTS: Door-to-drug times were significantly longer for patients identified as African American/black (41.1 minutes), Hispanic (36.1 minutes), and Asian/Pacific Islander (37.4 minutes), compared with patients identified as white (33.8 minutes) (P{\textless}.01 for all). Door-to-balloon times for patients identified as African American/black (122.3 minutes) or Hispanic (114.8 minutes) were significantly longer than for patients identified as white (103.4 minutes) (P{\textless}.001 for both). Racial/ethnic differences were still significant but were substantially reduced after accounting for differences in mean times to treatment for the hospitals in which patients were treated; significant racial/ethnic differences persisted after further adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, insurance status, and clinical and hospital characteristics (P{\textless}.01 for all). CONCLUSION: A substantial portion of the racial/ethnic disparity in time to treatment was accounted for by the specific hospital to which patients were admitted, in contrast to differential treatment by race/ethnicity inside the hospital.},

Deferred acceptance algorithms are at the basis of a number of labor market clearinghouses around the world, and have recently been implemented in school choice systems in Boston and New York City. In addition, the study of markets that have failed in ways that can be fixed with centralized mechanisms has led to a deeper understanding of some of the tasks a marketplace needs to accomplish to perform well. In particular, marketplaces work well when they provide thickness to the market, help it deal with the congestion that thickness can bring, and make it safe for participants to act effectively on their preferences. Centralized clearinghouses organized around the deferred acceptance algorithm can have these properties, and this has sometimes allowed failed markets to be reorganized. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems has grown rapidly over the last decade, partly because of various government incentives. In the United States, among the largest and longest-running incentives have been those established in California. Building on past research, this report addresses the still-unanswered question: to what degree have the direct PV incentives in California been passed through from installers to consumers? This report helps address this question by carefully examining the residential PV market in California (excluding a certain class of third-party-owned PV systems) and applying both a structural-modeling approach and a reduced-form regression analysis to estimate the incentive pass-through rate. The results suggest an average pass-through rate of direct incentives of nearly 100{\%}, though with regional differences among California counties. While these results could have multiple explanations, they suggest a relatively competitive market and well-functioning subsidy program. Further analysis is required to determine whether similar results broadly apply to other states, to other customer segments, to all third-party-owned PV systems, or to all forms of financial incentives for solar (considering not only direct state subsidies, but also utility electric bill savings and federal tax incentives).},

abstract = {This paper uses the Saver's Credit to analyze taxpayers' understanding of, and responses to, tax incentives. The Saver's Credit is a tax credit designed to encourage retirement savings among low and middle income households; however, the credit's structure creates "notches", or discontinuous jumps, within a household's budget constraint. These notches provide an incentive to manipulate adjusted gross income to fall just below the level where the credit decreases. I use Public Use Tax Files from the Internal Revenue Service to test whether taxpayers bunch their income at the notch created by the Saver's Credit. I find strong evidence that bunching occurred in response to the credit, which implies that taxpayers claiming the credit understood the incentives for bunching and indeed manipulated their incomes accordingly. I then exploit the discontinuity in credit rates to analyze the credit's impact on retirement contribution behavior using a regression discontinuity approach, and find that the credit failed to generate a statistically significant effect on the level of retirement contributions. These results imply that the Saver's Credit is more effective at providing transfers to low and middle income taxpayers than at increasing retirement contributions. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Both government and private health care systems have engaged in efforts to improve quality, but the effect of these initiatives on racial and ethnic disparities has not been well studied. In the decade following an organizational transformation, the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system achieved substantial improvements in quality of care with minimal racial disparities for most process-of-care measures, such as rates of cholesterol screenings. However, in our study we observed a striking disconnect between high levels of performance on widely used process measures and modest levels of improvement in clinical outcomes, such as control of blood pressure, blood glucose, and cholesterol levels. We also observed a gap in clinical outcomes of as much as nine percentage points between African American veterans and white veterans. Almost all of the disparity in outcomes in the VA was explained by within-facility disparity, which suggests that VA medical centers need to measure and address racial gaps in care for their patient populations. Moreover, because cardiovascular disease and diabetes are major contributors to racial disparities in life expectancy, the findings of this study and others underscore the urgency of focused efforts to improve intermediate outcomes among African Americans in the VA and other settings.},

This article examines both the logic of this thesis and the available empirical evidence on the origins of the coverage exclusions. The author concludes that the racial-bias thesis is both conceptually flawed and unsupported by the existing empirical evidence. The exclusion of agricultural and domestic workers from the early program was due to considerations of administrative feasibility involving tax-collection procedures.

abstract = {A recent literature has constructed top income shares time series over the long run for more than twenty countries using income tax statistics. Top incomes represent a small share of the population but a very significant share of total income and total taxes paid. Hence, aggregate economic growth per capita and Gini inequality indexes are sensitive to excluding or including top incomes. We discuss the estimation methods and issues that arise when constructing top income share series, including income definition and comparability over time and across countries, tax avoidance, and tax evasion. We provide a summary of the key empirical findings. Most countries experience a dramatic drop in top income shares in the first part of the twentieth century in general due to shocks to top capital incomes during the wars and depression shocks. Top income shares do not recover in the immediate postwar decades. However, over the last thirty years, top income shares have increased substantially in English speaking countries and in India and China but not in continental European countries or Japan. This increase is due in part to an unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. As a result, wage income comprises a larger fraction of top incomes than in the past. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and empirical models that have been proposed to account for the facts and the main questions that remain open. (JEL D31, D63, H26, N30)},

This Review documents the central role of both the supply and demand for skills in shaping inequality, discusses why skill demands have persistently risen in industrialized countries, and considers the economic value of inequality alongside its potential social costs. I conclude by highlighting the constructive role for public policy in fostering skills formation and preserving economic mobility.},

The bottom three income quintiles have received about 10{\%} of all credits, while the top quintile has received about 60{\%}. The most extreme is the program aimed at electric vehicles, where we find that the top income quintile has received about 90{\%} of all credits.

abstract = {This paper is an extensive revision and expansion of Working Paper No. 1402. It centers on a new time series of life expectations in the U.S. since 1720, which has been constructed from the NBER/CPE pilot sample of genealogies. Native—born Americans achieved remarkably long life expectations toward the end of the eighteenth century but then experienced a 70-year decline. A new rise began late in the 1850s but it was not until 1930 that the Americans again achieved the level of life expectation that was attained in 1790. Second, time series on average adult stature of national populations in North America and Europe are used as indexes of nutritional status (not diet alone but diet net of prior claims). These series are shown to be highly correlated with the series on e10 and other measures of mortality. It is estimated that improvements in nutritional status may have accounted for as much as four-tenths of the secular decline in mortality rates, but nearly all of this effect was concentrated in the reduction of infant mortality. Additional results include an assessment of the effect of toxic substances on the mortality rates of the English peerage; an estimate of the distribution of shortfalls in English supplies of food between 1540 and 1871, which reveals that famines were due primarily to social misallocations of food rather than to large declines in supply; and adjustments of conventional estimates of U.S. per capita income for the increase in mortality, which reduce the rate of economic growth between 1790 and 1860 by nearly 40 percent.},

In a recent paper published in the 1982 issue of "The American Economic Review," Robert Higgs uses Georgia tax assessment records to show that blacks accumulated property more rapidly than whites during this period, subject to short-run fluctuations in cotton income. Cross-sectional regressions reveal that black wealth varied inversely with illiteracy, the price of land and the tenancy rate; positively with cotton cultivation, the presence of plantation agriculture, and population density; but was insignificantly affected by racial composition. This comment extends Higgs' findings in two directions. First, race-specific data on assessed wealth are examined for five additional states. Second, because the data are assessed and not true wealth, the sensitivity of the results to cross-sectional and temporal variation in assessment ratios is an important issue.},

Although qualitative evidence shows that slavery has been a key factor behind the prevalence of violence, especially in South USA (Cash, 1941; Franklin, 1956; Gastil, 1971; Wyatt-Brown, 1986), no empirical evidence supports this claim so far. I propose that the proportion of slaves in a certain county in 1860 is positively correlated with the rate of violent crimes in 2000. As violence was extensively used to control slaves for hundreds of years, a culture of violence was formed and persisted through time. Extending Engermann and Sokoloff's hypotheses (1997; 2002), I empirically examine two hypotheses: (1) slavery has a long-term effect on violent crime. (2) Such long-term effect is mainly transmitted through inequality. The results show that slavery in 1860 is positively associated with violent crime in 2000. Testing the second hypothesis, I find that land inequality in 1860 has a long-term significant effect on contemporary violent crime.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among blacks and whites in the United States. Despite this, there are insufficient data on the long-term prognosis of black patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as the major clinical related determinants of outcome.

METHODS: We studied 22,618 patients (3,314 black) having significant CAD findings at cardiac catheterization performed at Duke from January 1986 to December 2004 with follow-up through June 2006. Using Kaplan-Meier and Cox modeling, we compared unadjusted and adjusted long-term survival by patient race and gender (median follow-up 7.6 years, interquartile range 3.5-13.0) as well as identified major patient characteristics associated with survival.

RESULTS: Blacks with CAD were younger; were more often female; had lower median household incomes; and had more hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. The number of coronary vessels with significant disease was similar by race. At 15-year follow-up, black women had the lowest survival and white men had the highest (41.5{\%} vs 45.8{\%}, P {\textless} .0001). Blacks were less likely to receive initial therapy with coronary revascularization (odds ratio 0.66, 95{\%} CI 0.60-0.72, P {\textless} .0001). After adjusting for baseline clinical and demographic characteristics and initial treatment selection, black race remained an independent predictor of lower survival (hazard ratio 2.54, 95{\%} CI 1.60-4.04, P {\textless} .0001).

CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CAD, blacks have lower long-term survival compared with whites. The difference may be partially, but not fully, explained by differences in cardiovascular risk factors and 30-day revascularization rates.},

abstract = {External shocks may cause a decline in the productivity of fixed capital in certain regions of an economy. Exogenous obstacles to migration make it hard for workers in those regions to reallocate to more prosperous regions. In addition, firms may devise ‘‘attachment'' strategies to keep workers from moving out of a local labor market. When workers are compensated in kind, they find it difficult to raise the cash needed for migration. This endogenous obstacle to migration has not yet been considered in the literature. The article shows that the feasibility of attachment depends on the inherited structure of local labor markets: attachment can exist in equilibrium only if the labor market is sufficiently concentrated. Attachment is beneficial for both employ- ers and employees but hurts the unemployed and the self-employed. An analysis of matched household-firm data from the Russian Federation corroborates the theory.},

abstract = {The biggest problem with health care isn't with insurance or politics. It's that we're measuring the wrong things the wrong way. they are unable to link cost to process improvements or outcomes, preventing them from making sys-temic and sustainable cost reductions. Instead, pro-viders (and payors) turn to simplistic actions such as across-the-board cuts in expensive services, staff compensation, and head count. But imposing arbi-trary spending limits on discrete components of care, or on specifi c line-item expense categories, achieves only marginal savings that often lead to higher total systems costs and poorer outcomes. For example, as payors introduce high copayments to limit the use of expensive drugs, costs may balloon elsewhere in the system should patients' overall health deteriorate and they subsequently require more services. Poor cost measurement has also led to huge cross-subsidies across services. Providers are gener-ously reimbursed for some services and incur losses on others. These cross-subsidies introduce major distortions in the supply and effi ciency of care. The inability to properly measure cost and compare cost with outcomes is at the root of the incentive problem in health care and has severely retarded the shift to more eff ective reimbursement approaches. Finally, poor measurement of cost and outcomes also means that eff ective and effi cient providers go unrewarded, while ineffi cient ones have little incen-tive to improve. Indeed, institutions may be penalized when the improvements they make in treatments and processes reduce the need for highly reimbursed services. Without proper measurement, the healthy dynamic of competition—in which the highest-value providers expand and prosper—breaks down. In-stead we have zero-sum competition in which health care providers destroy value by focusing on highly reimbursed services, shifting costs to other entities, or pursuing piecemeal and ineff ective line-item cost reductions. Current health care reform initiatives will exacerbate the situation by increasing access to an in-effi cient system without addressing the fundamental U.S. health care costs currently exceed 17{\%} of GDP and continue to rise. Other countries spend less of their GDP on health care but have the same increasing trend. Explanations are not hard to fi nd. The aging of populations and the de-velopment of new treatments are behind some of the increase. Perverse incentives also contribute: Third-party payors (insurance companies and governments) reimburse for procedures performed rather than out-comes achieved, and patients bear little responsibility for the cost of the health care services they demand. But few acknowledge a more fundamental source of escalating costs: the system by which those costs are measured. To put it bluntly, there is an almost complete lack of understanding of how much it costs to deliver patient care, much less how those costs compare with the outcomes achieved. Instead of focusing on the costs of treating individual patients with specifi c medical conditions over their full cycle of care, providers aggregate and analyze costs at the specialty or service department level. Making matters worse, participants in the health care system do not even agree on what they mean by costs. When politicians and policy makers talk about cost reduction and " bending the cost curve, " they are typically referring to how much the government or insurers pay to providers—not to the costs incurred by providers to deliver health care services. Cutting payor reimbursement does reduce the bill paid by insurers and lowers providers' revenues, but it does nothing to reduce the actual costs of delivering care. Providers share in this confusion. They often allocate their costs to procedures, departments, and services based not on the actual resources used to deliver care but on how much they are reimbursed. But reim-bursement itself is based on arbitrary and inaccurate assumptions about the intensity of care. Poor costing systems have disastrous conse-quences. It is a well-known management axiom that what is not measured cannot be managed or im-proved. Since providers misunderstand their costs, 48 Harvard Business Review September 2011},

Finally, we show that in settings with bilateral contracts and transferable utility (but an arbitrary contractual network), the existence of competitive equilibria is guaranteed regardless of agents' preferences.

Policies that produce a one-time reduction in the level of spending, for example by making hospitals more efficient, may do little to reduce subsequent annual spending growth. To identify factors causing health care spending to grow the fastest, we focused on three conditions in the Medicare population: heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and hip fractures. We found that spending on postacute care-long-term hospital care, rehabilitation care, and skilled nursing facility care--was the fastest growing major spending category and accounted for a large portion of spending growth in 1994-2009. During that period average spending for postacute care doubled for patients with hip fractures, more than doubled for those with congestive heart failure, and more than tripled for those with heart attacks. We conclude that policies aimed at controlling acute care spending, such as bundled payments for short-term hospital spending and physician services, are likely to be more effective if they include postacute care, as is currently being tested under Medicare's Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Initiative.},

A total of 69 men without and 77 men with prior evidence of coronary heart disease were victims of sudden death. Out of 50 sudden deaths in women (34{\%} of female coronary heart disease deaths), 34 occurred in women without prior coronary disease and 16 in women with prior coronary disease. Incidence rates for sudden death were substantially greater in men than in women and in both men and women with, as opposed to without, prior coronary heart disease. The classic coronary heart disease risk factors, left ventricular hypertrophy, age, serum cholesterol, number of cigarettes smoked daily, relative weight, and systolic blood pressure, emerged from multiple logistic regression analysis of sudden death in men without prior coronary heart disease. However, in men with prior coronary disease, only left ventricular hypertrophy and intraventricular block, and no other classic risk factors, were positive predictors of sudden death. For women without prior coronary disease, significant factors were age, vital capacity, hematocrit, serum cholesterol (marginal), and serum glucose (marginal). In women with prior coronary disease, only hematocrit was a consistent predictor. Reasons for the substantial differences in sudden death risk profiles between men and women are not entirely clear, but limitations in data may partially account for these sex differences.},

Using detailed information on the users' attributes and interactions, we estimate a model of mate preferences.  Based on the estimated preferences, we use the Gale-Shapley algorithm to predict the stable matches among the users of the dating site.  Comparing the predicted and observed matching patterns, we find that the Gale-Shapley model explains the matches achieved by the online dating market well, and that the matches are approximately efficient (within the class of stable matches).  We then explore whether the estimated mate preferences, in conjunction with the Gale-Shapley algorithm, can explain the matching patterns in offline, real-world marriages.  We find that we can predict assortative mating patterns that are similar to those observed in marriages.  As the Gale-Shapley algorithm predicts match outcomes in the absence of search costs, we conclude that mate preferences, not search frictions, explain much of the strong degree of sorting along various attributes in marriages.},

The post-World War II growth in medical expenditures is either largely attributable to technological change induced by increased insurance coverage, a hypothesis that cannot be tested, or to factors other than increased insurance coverage. The authors reject the hypothesis that less favorable coverage of outpatient services increases total expenditure, e.g., by deterring preventive care. Coauthors are Joseph P.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Massachusetts 2006 health care reform has been called a model for the Affordable Care Act. The law attained near-universal insurance coverage and increased access to care. Its effect on population health is less clear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the Massachusetts reform was associated with changes in all-cause mortality and mortality from causes amenable to health care. DESIGN: Comparison of mortality rates before and after reform in Massachusetts versus a control group with similar demographics and economic conditions. SETTING: Changes in mortality rates for adults in Massachusetts counties from 2001 to 2005 (prereform) and 2007 to 2010 (postreform) were compared with changes in a propensity score-defined control group of counties in other states. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 20 to 64 years in Massachusetts and control group counties. MEASUREMENTS: Annual county-level all-cause mortality in age-, sex-, and race-specific cells (n = 146,825) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Compressed Mortality File. Secondary outcomes were deaths from causes amenable to health care, insurance coverage, access to care, and self-reported health. RESULTS: Reform in Massachusetts was associated with a significant decrease in all-cause mortality compared with the control group (-2.9{\%}; P = 0.003, or an absolute decrease of 8.2 deaths per 100,000 adults). Deaths from causes amenable to health care also significantly decreased (-4.5{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). Changes were larger in counties with lower household incomes and higher prereform uninsured rates. Secondary analyses showed significant gains in coverage, access to care, and self-reported health. The number needed to treat was approximately 830 adults gaining health insurance to prevent 1 death per year. LIMITATIONS: Nonrandomized design subject to unmeasured confounders. Massachusetts results may not generalize to other states. CONCLUSION: Health reform in Massachusetts was associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality and deaths from causes amenable to health care. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.},

abstract = {This paper estimates the political and economic effects of the 19th century disenfranchise- ment of black citizens in the U.S. South. Using adjacent county-pairs that straddle state bound- aries, I first examine the effect of voting restrictions on political competition. I find that poll taxes and literacy tests each lowered overall electoral turnout by 10-23{\%} and increased the Demo- cratic vote share in national elections by 5{\%}-10{\%}. Second, employing newly collected data on schooling inputs, I show that disenfranchisement reduced the teacher-child and teacher-student ratio in black schools. Finally, I develop a model of suffrage restriction and redistribution in a 2-factor economy with occupational choice to generate sufficient statistics for welfare analysis of the incidence of black disenfranchisement. Consistent with the model, disenfranchised counties experienced a 7{\%} increase in land and farm values per decade, despite a 4{\%} fall in the black population share. The estimated factor market responses suggest that black labor bore a col- lective loss from disenfranchisement equivalent to at least 13{\%} of annual income, much of which was transferred to landowners.},

Second, we reviewed the literature on economic models of the cost of emergency care and found that the results are inconclusive and incomplete.

abstract = {Mortality rates in the United States fell more rapidly during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries than in any other period in American history. This decline coincided with an epidemiological transition and the disappearance of a mortality "penalty" associated with living in urban areas. There is little empirical evidence and much unresolved debate about what caused these improvements, however. In this article, we report the causal influence of clean water technologies--filtration and chlorination--on mortality in major cities during the early twentieth century. Plausibly exogenous variation in the timing and location of technology adoption was used to identify these effects, and the validity of this identifying assumption is examined in detail. We found that clean water was responsible for nearly half the total mortality reduction in major cities, three quarters of the infant mortality reduction, and nearly two thirds of the child mortality reduction. Rough calculations suggest that the social rate of return to these technologies was greater than 23 to 1, with a cost per person-year saved by clean water of about dollar 500 in 2003 dollars. Implications for developing countries are briefly considered.},

In the year after random assignment, the treat- ment group selected by the lottery was about 25 percentage points more likely to have insurance than the control group that was not selected. We find that in this first year, the treatment group had substantively and statistically signifi- cantly higher health care utilization (including primary and preventive care as well as hospitalizations), lower out-of-pocket medical expenditures and medical debt (including fewer bills sent to collection), and better self-reported physical and mental health than the control group.

DATA SOURCES: Claims for 37.6 million privately insured employees and their dependents from the Truven Health Market Scan Database in 2009. Measures of insurer market structure derived from Health Leaders Inter study data. METHODS: Regression models are used to estimate the association between insurance market concentration and health care spending, utilization, and price, adjusting for differences in patient characteristics and other market-level traits. RESULTS: Insurance market concentration is inversely related to prices and spending, but positively related to utilization. Our results imply that, after adjusting for input price differences, a market with two equal size insurers is associated with 3.9 percent lower medical care spending per capita (p = .002) and 5.0 percent lower prices for health care services relative to one with three equal size insurers (p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSION: Greater fragmentation in the insurance market might lead to higher prices and higher spending for care, suggesting some of the gains from insurer competition may be absorbed by higher prices for health care. Greater attention to prices and utilization in the provider market may need to accompany procompetitive insurance market strategies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of more intensive treatments on mortality in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DESIGN: Analysis of incremental treatment effects using differential distances as instrumental variables to account for unobserved case-mix variation (selection bias) in observational Medicare claims data (1987 through 1991). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival to 4 years after AMI. RESULTS: Patients who receive different treatments differ in observable and unobservable health characteristics, biasing estimates of treatment effects based on standard methods of adjusting for observable differences. Patients' differential distances to alternative types of hospitals are strong independent predictors of how intensively an AMI patient will be treated and appear uncorrelated with health status. Thus, differential distances approximately randomize patients to different likelihoods of receiving intensive treatments. Comparisons of patient groups that differ only in differential distances show that the impact on mortality at 1 to 4 years after AMI of the incremental ("marginal") use of invasive procedures in Medicare patients was at most 5 percentage points; this gain was achieved during the first day of hospitalization and therefore appears attributable to treatments other than the procedures. Admission to a hospital treating a high volume of AMI patients was associated with an effect on mortality at 4 years of less than 1 percentage point, again arising on day 1. Patients living in rural areas experienced acute mortality that was an additional 0.6 percentage-point higher, after controlling for less access to intensive treatments. CONCLUSIONS: For elderly patients with AMI, the aspects of treatment most affecting long-term survival relate to care within the first 24 hours of admission. The survival benefits from greater use of catheterization and revascularization procedures appear minimal in marginal patients.},

Yet the data at their disposal are limited, especially since hospitals' audited financial statements--the "gold standard" in hospital financial reporting--are not publicly available in many states. As a result, the Medicare Cost Report (MCR), filed annually by most U.S. hospitals in order to receive payment for treating Medicare patients, has become the primary public source of hospital financial information. However, financial accounting elements in the MCR are unreliable, poorly defined, and lacking in critical detail. Comparative analyses of MCRs and matched, audited financial statements reveal long-standing problems with the MCR's data, including major differences in reported profits; variations in the reporting of both revenues and expenses; an absence of relevant details, such as charity care, bad debt, operating versus nonoperating income, and affiliate transactions; an inconsistent classification of changes in net assets; and a failure to provide cash flow statements. Because of these problems, MCR financial data give only a limited and often inaccurate picture of the financial position of hospitals. Audited financial statements provide a more complete perspective, enabling analysts to address important questions left unanswered by the MCR data. Regulatory action is needed to create a national database of financial information based upon audited statements.},

abstract = {Why have health care costs moderated in the last decade? Some have suggested that the Great Recession alone was the cause, but health expenditure growth in the depths of the recession was nearly identical to growth prior to the recession. Nor can the Affordable Care Act (ACA) take credit, since the slowdown began prior to its implementation. Instead, we identify three primary causes of the slowdown: the rise in high-deductible insurance plans, state-level efforts to control Medicaid costs, and a general slowdown in the diffusion of new technology, particularly for use by the Medicare population. A more difficult question is: will this slowdown continue? On this question, we are pessimistic, and not entirely because a similar (and temporary) slowdown occurred in the early 1990s. The primary determinant of long-term growth is the continued development of expensive technology, and there is little evidence of a permanent slowdown in that pipeline. Proton beam accelerators are on target to double between 2010 and 2014, while the market for heart assist devices (costing more than {\$}300,000 each) is projected to grow rapidly. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) and emboldened insurance companies may yet stifle health care cost growth, but our best estimate over the next two decades is that health care costs will grow at GDP plus 1.2 percent, a rate lower than previous estimates but still on track to cause serious fiscal pain for taxpayers and workers who bear the costs of higher premiums.},

abstract = {Economists have lately been called upon not only to analyze markets, but to design them. Market design involves a responsibility for detail, a need to deal with all of a market's complications, not just its principle features. Designers therefore cannot work only with the simple conceptual models used for theoretical insights into the general working of markets. Instead, market design calls for an engineering approach. Drawing primarily on the design of the entry level labor market for American doctors (the National Resident Matching Program), and of the auctions of radio spectrum conducted by the Federal Communications Commission, this paper makes the case that experimental and computational economics are natural complements to game theory in the work of design. The paper also argues that some of the challenges facing both markets involve dealing with related kinds of complementarities, and that this suggests an agenda for future theoretical research.},

However it is increasingly apparent that a focus on individual medical treatments as an approach to the determination of health is inappropriate,and that health is determined as much by health policies as by medicine. The introduction of the dialogue of human rights into domestic law, along with recognition of the global nature of threats to health from disease, the environment and development, necessitate a broader approach to health law commentary. This book addresses the legal framework and regulation of the public dimension of health. The constraints on formulation of health policies and the legal infrastructure of health regulation at national, European and international level are examined. Particular health concerns are then considered in the context of law. This book provides an essential text for any health law or public health programme, and will be useful to commentators with research interests in any area of health.},

abstract = {We propose a criterion of approximate incentive compatibility, strategy-proofness in the large (SP-L), and argue that it is a useful second-best to exact strategy-proofness (SP) for market design. Conceptually, SP-L requires that an agent who regards a mechanism's “prices” as exogenous to her report – be they traditional prices as in an auction mechanism, or price-like statistics in an assignment or matching mechanism – has a dominant strategy to report truthfully. Mathematically, SP-L weakens SP in two ways: (i) truth-telling is required to be approximately optimal (within epsilon in a large enough market) rather than exactly optimal, and (ii) incentive compatibility is evaluated ex interim, with respect to all full-support i.i.d. probability distributions of play, rather than ex post with respect to all possible realizations of play. This places SP-L in between the traditional notion of approximate strategy-proofness, which evaluates incentives to manipulate ex post, and the traditional notion of approximate Bayes-Nash incentive compatibility, which evaluates incentives to manipulate ex interim with respect to the single common-knowledge probability distribution associated with Bayes-Nash equilibrium.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether a price increase on regular (sugary) soft drinks and an educational intervention would reduce their sales. METHODS: We implemented a 5-phase intervention at the Brigham and Women's Hospital cafeteria in Boston, Massachusetts. After posting existing prices of regular and diet soft drinks and water during baseline, we imposed several interventions in series: a price increase of 35{\%} on regular soft drinks, a reversion to baseline prices (washout), an educational campaign, and a combination price and educational period. We collected data from a comparison site, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, also in Boston, for the final 3 phases. RESULTS: Sales of regular soft drinks declined by 26{\%} during the price increase phase. This reduction in sales persisted throughout the study period, with an additional decline of 18{\%} during the combination phase compared with the washout period. Education had no independent effect on sales. Analysis of the comparison site showed no change in regular soft drink sales during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: A price increase may be an effective policy mechanism to decrease sales of regular soda. Further multisite studies in varied populations are warranted to confirm these results.},

abstract = {F ederal and state governments in the United States have responded to rising con-cerns about the consequences of petroleum consumption in part by introduc-ing tax subsidies for new vehicles that feature fuel-efcient technologies, including gas-electric hybrids. These policies aim to reduce oil consumption in the personal transportation sector, which accounts for 40 percent of gasoline consumption and 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2007). At the federal level, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced a substantial personal income tax credit for hybrids. At the state level, thirteen states have passed tax incentives for hybrids, and many others have considered similar actions. In this paper, I determine who benets from tax incentives for hybrids using transaction level microdata to estimate the incidence of existing subsidies for the Toyota Prius. I nd that consumers capture nearly all of the benets of tax subsidies. Transaction prices for the Prius did not change following changes of up to {\$}2,650 in subsidy value. Since consumers receive the subsidy directly from the government after their purchase, constant transaction prices imply that consumers captured the benets of government intervention. This nding has implications for the evaluation of existing and future policies. It also has broader implications for the study of tax incidence},

@article{Kodner2000,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Integrated care for the frail elderly and other populations with complex, chronic, disabling conditions has taken centre stage among policymakers, planners and providers in the United States and other countries. There is a growing belief that integrated care strategies offer the potential to improve service co-ordination, quality outcomes, and efficiency. Therefore, it is critical to have a conceptual understanding of the meaning of integrated care and its various organisational models, as well as practical examples of how such models work. This article examines so-called "fully integrated" models of care in detail, concentrating on two major, well-established American programs, the social health maintenance organisation and the program of all-inclusive care for the elderly. THEORY: A major challenge to understanding the performance and outcomes of fully integrated care and other organisational models is the lack of a meaningful, analytical paradigm. This article builds upon the work of Walter Leutz, to develop a framework by which new and existing programs can be analysed. This framework is then applied to the two American models that are the focus of this article. METHODS: Existing data about integrated care in general, and the two model programs in particular, were collected and analysed from reports published by governmental and non-governmental organisations, and journal articles retrieved from Medline, HealthStar and other sources. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This analysis strongly suggests that fully integrated models of care, such as the social health maintenance organisation and program of all-inclusive care for the elderly, are not only feasible, but offer significant potential to improve the delivery of health and social care for frail elderly patients. In addition, the authors identify the factors that are the most critical to the success of fully integrated care, and offer lessons for their development and implementation. Finally, issues are raised concerning the transferability of this complex model to other countries, as well as the vital importance of evidence-based evaluation research in furthering the evolution of integrated care.},

@article{Himmelstein2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many believe that computerization will improve health care quality, reduce costs, and increase administrative efficiency. However, no previous studies have examined computerization's cost and quality impacts at a diverse national sample of hospitals.

METHODS: We linked data from an annual survey of computerization at approximately 4000 hospitals for the period from 2003 to 2007 with administrative cost data from Medicare Cost Reports and cost and quality data from the 2008 Dartmouth Health Atlas. We calculated an overall computerization score and 3 subscores based on 24 individual computer applications, including the use of computerized practitioner order entry and electronic medical records. We analyzed whether more computerized hospitals had lower costs of care or administration, or better quality. We also compared hospitals included on a list of the "100 Most Wired" with others.

RESULTS: More computerized hospitals had higher total costs in bivariate analyses (r=0.06, P=.001) but not multivariate analyses (P=.69). Neither overall computerization scores nor subscores were consistently related to administrative costs, but hospitals that increased computerization faster had more rapid administrative cost increases (P=.0001). Higher overall computerization scores correlated weakly with better quality scores for acute myocardial infarction (r=0.07, P=.003), but not for heart failure, pneumonia, or the 3 conditions combined. In multivariate analyses, more computerized hospitals had slightly better quality. Hospitals on the "Most Wired" list performed no better than others on quality, costs, or administrative costs.

CONCLUSION: As currently implemented, hospital computing might modestly improve process measures of quality but does not reduce administrative or overall costs.},

abstract = {The entry-level market for American gastroenterologists was organized by a centralized clearinghouse from 1986 to 1996. Before, and since, it has been conducted via a decentralized market in which appointment dates have unraveled to well over a year before the start of employment. We find that, both before and after the years in which the centralized clearinghouse was used, gastroenterologists are less mobile and more likely to be employed at the same hospital in which they were internal medicine residents than when the clearinghouse was in use. This suggests that the clearinghouse not only coordinates the timing of appointments but also increases the scope of the market, compared to a decentralized market with early appointments.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented racial disparities in treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among Medicare beneficiaries. However, the extent to which unobserved differences between hospitals explains some of these differences is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether the observed racial treatment disparities for AMI narrow when analyses account for differences in where blacks and whites are hospitalized. RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study using Medicare claims and medical record review. SUBJECTS: This study included 130,709 white and 8286 black Medicare patients treated in 4690 hospitals in 50 US states for confirmed AMI in 1994 and 1995. MEASURES: Measures in this study were receipt of reperfusion, aspirin, and smoking cessation counseling during hospitalization; prescription of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and beta-blocker at hospital discharge; receipt of cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or bypass surgery (CABG) within 30 days of AMI; and 30-day and 1-year mortality. RESULTS: Within-hospital analyses narrowed or erased black-white disparities for medical treatments received during the acute hospitalization, widened black-white disparities for follow-up surgical treatments, and augmented the survival advantage among blacks. These findings indicate that, on average, blacks went to hospitals that had lower rates of evidence-based medical treatments, higher rates of cardiac procedures, and worse risk-adjusted mortality after AMI. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating the hospital effect altered the findings of racial disparity analyses in AMI and explained more of the disparities than race. A policy of targeted hospital-level interventions may be required for success of national efforts to reduce disparities.},

The basic conclusion is that, while much progress has been made in documenting regional, temporal and occupational differentials, further insights will require a large amount of new evidence, particularly on retail prices. The paper also uses existing regional data on wholesale prices to construct new regional indices of real wages for artisans and unskilled labor from 1821 to 1856. The new indices suggest that real wage growth was less than previously thought in the 1930s and that growth was, by comparison with later periods in American history, very erratic in the short-run. The erratic nature of real wage growth was a consequence of persistent effects of price and real shocks. },

abstract = {The role of improved schooling, a central part of most development strategies, has become controversial because expansion of school attainment has not guaranteed improved economic conditions. This paper reviews the role of cognitive skills in pro- moting economic well-being, with a particular focus on the role of school quality and quantity. It concludes that there is strong evidence that the cognitive skills of the population—rather than mere school attainment—are powerfully related to indi- vidual earnings, to the distribution of income, and to economic growth. New empiri- cal results show the importance of both minimal and high level skills, the comple- mentarity of skills and the quality of economic institutions, and the robustness of the relationship between skills and growth. International comparisons incorporating expanded data on cognitive skills reveal much larger skill deficits in developing coun- tries than generally derived from just school enrollment and attainment. The mag- nitude of change needed makes clear that closing the economic gap with developed countries will require major structural changes in schooling institutions.},

abstract = {Themajority of labor transactions throughout much of history and a significant frac- tion of such transactions in many developing countries today are “coercive,” in the sense that force or the threat of force plays a central role in convincing workers to accept employment or its terms.We propose a tractable principal–agent model of co- ercion, based on the idea that coercive activities by employers, or “guns,” affect the participation constraint of workers.We show that coercion and effort are complements, so that coercion increases effort, but coercion always reduces utilitarian social welfare. Better outside options for workers reduce coercion because of the complementarity between coercion and effort: workers with a better outside option exert lower effort in equilibrium and thus are coerced less. Greater demand for labor increases coercion because it increases equilibrium effort. We investigate the interaction between out- side options, market prices, and other economic variables by embedding the (coercive) principal–agent relationship in a general equilibrium setup, and studying when and how labor scarcity encourages coercion. General (market) equilibrium interactions working through the price of output lead to a positive relationship between labor scarcity and coercion along the lines of ideas suggested by Domar, while interactions those working through the outside option lead to a negative relationship similar to ideas advanced in neo-Malthusian historical analyses of the decline of feudalism. In net, a decline in available labor increases coercion in general equilibrium if and only if its direct (partial equilibrium) effect is to increase the price of output by more than it increases outside options. Our model also suggests that markets in slaves make slaves worse off, condi- tional on enslavement, and that coercion is more viable in industries that do not require relationship-specific investment by workers.},

Through the twentieth century in the United States and other high-income countries, growth in real incomes was accompanied by a historically unprecedented decline in mortality rates that caused life expectancy at birth to grow by nearly 30 years. In the years just after World War II, life expectancy gaps between countries were falling across the world. Poor countries enjoyed rapid increases in life-expectancy through the 1970s, with the gains in some cases exceeding an additional year of life expectancy per year, though the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the transition in Russia and Eastern Europe have changed that situation. We investigate the determinants of the historical decline in mortality, of differences in mortality across countries, and of differences in mortality across groups within countries. A good theory of mortality should explain all of the facts we will outline. No such theory exists at present, but at the end of the paper we will sketch a tentative synthesis.},

abstract = {Anecdotal evidence and several observational studies suggest that out-of-pocket medical costs are pivotal in a large fraction of consumer bankruptcy decisions. In this paper, we assess the contribution of medical costs to household bankruptcy risk by exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in publicly provided health insurance. Using cross-state variation in Medicaid expansions from 1992 to 2004, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility reduces personal bankruptcies by 8{\%}, with no evidence that business bankruptcies are similarly affected. We interpret our findings with a model in which health insurance imperfectly substitutes for other forms of financial protection, and we use the model to present simple calibration results which illustrate how our reduced-form parameter estimate affects the optimal level of health insurance benefits. We conclude with calculations which suggest that out-of-pocket medical costs are pivotal in roughly 26{\%} of personal bankruptcies among low-income households. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Sexual behavioural change is essential to prevent HIV infections in Africa and statistical analysis of risk factors at the individual-level may be used to design interventions. The importance of reducing cross-generational sex (young women having sex with older men) and delaying age at first sex on the spread of HIV at the population-level has been presumed but not scientifically investigated and quantified. Methods: A mathematical model of heterosexual spread of HIV was developed to predict the population-level impact of reducing cross-generational sex and delaying sexual debut. Results: The impact of behaviour change on the spread of HIV is sensitive to the structure and reaction of the sexual network. Reducing cross-generational sex could have little impact on the risk of infection unless it is accompanied by a reduction in the number of risky sexual contacts. Even peer-to-peer sexual mixing can support high endemic levels of HIV. The benefit of delaying sexual debut is comparatively small and is reduced if males continue to prefer young partners or if young women spend more time unmarried. In Manicaland, Zimbabwe, if older men were to use condoms as frequently as young men, the reduction in risk of infection could exceed that generated by a two-year delay in first sex. Conclusions: At the individual-level avoiding sex with older partners and delaying sexual debut can decrease the risk of infection but at the population-level these interventions may do little to limit the spread of HIV without wider-ranging behavioural changes throughout the sexual network.},

With the exception of black males, all recent gains in life expectancy at age twenty-five have occurred among better-educated groups, raising educational differentials in life expectancy by 30 percent.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of trends in the incidence of and survival after myocardial infarction (MI) in a community setting is important to understanding trends in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated race- and gender-specific trends in the incidence of hospitalized MI, case fatality, and CHD mortality from community-wide surveillance and validation of hospital discharges and of in- and out-of-hospital deaths among 35- to 74-year-old residents of 4 communities in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Biomarker adjustment accounted for change from reliance on cardiac enzymes to widespread use of troponin measurements over time. During 1987-2008, a total of 30 985 fatal or nonfatal hospitalized acute MI events occurred. Rates of CHD death among persons without a history of MI fell an average 4.7{\%}/y among men and 4.3{\%}/y among women. Rates of both in- and out-of-hospital CHD death declined significantly throughout the period. Age- and biomarker-adjusted average annual rate of incident MI decreased 4.3{\%} among white men, 3.8{\%} among white women, 3.4{\%} among black women, and 1.5{\%} among black men. Declines in CHD mortality and MI incidence were greater in the second decade (1997-2008). Failure to account for biomarker shift would have masked declines in incidence, particularly among blacks. Age-adjusted 28-day case fatality after hospitalized MI declined 3.5{\%}/y among white men, 3.6{\%}/y among black men, 3.0{\%}/y among white women, and 2.6{\%}/y among black women.

CONCLUSIONS: Although these findings from 4 communities may not be directly generalizable to blacks and whites in the entire United States, we observed significant declines in MI incidence, primarily as a result of downward trends in rates between 1997 and 2008.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) is a long-term care delivery and financing innovation. A major goal of PACE is prevention of unnecessary use of hospital and nursing home care. SETTING: PACE serves enrollees in day centers and clinics, their homes, hospitals and nursing homes. Beginning at On Lok in San Francisco, the PACE model has been successfully replicated across the country. In 1995, PACE was fully operational in 11 cities in nine states. PARTICIPANTS: To enroll in PACE, a person must be 55 years of age or older, be certified by the state as eligible for care in a nursing home and live in the program's defined geographical catchment area. PACE participants are ethnically diverse. In 1995, the average PACE enrollee was 80.0 years old and had an average of 7.8 medical conditions and 2.7 dependencies in Activities of Daily Living. A significant number have bladder incontinence (55{\%}). Many enrollees (39{\%}) live alone in the community, and 14{\%} have no means of informal support. INTERVENTION: Medicare and Medicaid waivers allow delivery of services beyond the usual Medicare and Medicaid benefits. The PACE service delivery system is comprehensive, uses an interdisciplinary team for care management, and integrates primary and specialty medical care. PACE receives monthly capitation payments from Medicare and Medicaid. Patients ineligible for Medicaid pay privately. RESULTS: Outcomes of PACE programs have been positive. There has been steady census growth, good consumer satisfaction, reduction in use of institutional care, controlled utilization of medical services, and cost savings to public and private payers of care, including Medicare and Medicaid. However, starting up a PACE program requires substantial time and capital, and the model has not yet attracted large numbers of older middle income adults. CONCLUSION: The growing number of older people in the United States challenges healthcare providers and policy makers alike to provide high quality care in an environment of shrinking resources. The PACE model's comprehensiveness of health and social services, its cost-effective coordinated system of care delivery, and its method of integrated financing have wide applicability and appeal.},

abstract = {Greater patient cost-sharing could help reduce the fiscal pressures associated with insurance expansion by reducing the scope for moral hazard. But it is possible that low-income recipients are unable to cut back on utilization wisely and that, as a result, higher cost-sharing will lead to worse health and higher downstream costs through increased use of inpatient and outpatient care. We use exogenous variation in the copayments faced by low-income enrollees in the Massachusetts Commonwealth Care program to study these effects. We estimate separate price elasticities of demand by type of service. Overall, we find price elasticities of about -0.16 for this low-income population - similar to elasticities calculated for higher-income populations in other settings. These elasticities are somewhat smaller for the chronically sick, especially for those with asthma, diabetes, and high cholesterol. These lower elasticities are attributable to lower responsiveness to prices across all categories of service, and to some statistically insignificant increases in inpatient care. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) and cost-effectiveness analysis are valuable tools for informing health policy and clinical care decisions. Despite the increased availability of rich observational databases with economic measures, few researchers have the skills needed to conduct valid and reliable cost analyses for CER.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper are to (i) describe a practical approach for calculating cost estimates from hospital charges in discharge data using publicly available hospital cost reports, and (ii) assess the impact of using different methods for cost estimation in maternal and child health (MCH) studies by conducting economic analyses on gestational diabetes (GDM) and pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity.

METHODS: In Florida, we have constructed a clinically enhanced, longitudinal, encounter-level MCH database covering over 2.3 million infants (and their mothers) born alive from 1998 to 2009. Using this as a template, we describe a detailed methodology to use publicly available data to calculate hospital-wide and department-specific cost-to-charge ratios (CCRs), link them to the master database, and convert reported hospital charges to refined cost estimates. We then conduct an economic analysis as a case study on women by GDM and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) status to compare the impact of using different methods on cost estimation.

RESULTS: Over 60 {\%} of inpatient charges for birth hospitalizations came from the nursery/labor/delivery units, which have very different cost-to-charge markups (CCR = 0.70) than the commonly substituted hospital average (CCR = 0.29). Using estimated mean, per-person maternal hospitalization costs for women with GDM as an example, unadjusted charges ({\$}US14,696) grossly overestimated actual cost, compared with hospital-wide ({\$}US3,498) and department-level ({\$}US4,986) CCR adjustments. However, the refined cost estimation method, although more accurate, did not alter our conclusions that infant/maternal hospitalization costs were significantly higher for women with GDM than without, and for overweight/obese women than for those in a normal BMI range.

CONCLUSIONS: Cost estimates, particularly among MCH-related services, vary considerably depending on the adjustment method. Our refined approach will be valuable to researchers interested in incorporating more valid estimates of cost into databases with linked hospital discharge files.},

These applicants were given equivalent r{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}s and sent to apply in tandem for hundreds of entry-level jobs. Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer. In fact, black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison. Additional qualitative evidence from our applicants' experiences further illustrates the multiple points at which employment trajectories can be deflected by various forms of racial bias. These results point to the subtle yet systematic forms of discrimination that continue to shape employment opportunities for low-wage workers.},

abstract = {We estimate the effect of tax rebates offered by Canadian Provinces on the sales of hybrid electric vehicles. We find that these rebates led to a large increase in the market share of hybrid vehicles. In particular, we estimate that 26{\%} of the hybrid vehicles sold during the rebate programs can be attributed to the rebate, and that intermediate cars, intermediate SUVs and some high performance compact cars were crowded out as a result. However, this implies that the rebate programs also subsidized many consumers who would have bought either hybrid vehicles or other fuel-efficient vehicles in any case. Consequently, the average cost of reducing carbon emissions from these programs is estimated to be {\$}195 per tonne. {\textcopyright} 2010 .},

We then examine potential threats to the validity of a causal interpretation of the experimental treatment effects stemming from different study participation and differential reporting of outcomes across treatment arms. Finally, we re-consider the famous RAND estimate that the elasticity of medical spending with respect to its out-of-pocket price is -0.2, emphasizing the challenges associated with summarizing the experimental treatment effects from non-linear health insurance contracts using a single price elasticity.},

abstract = {The collapse of the clearinghouse for the entry-level gastroenterology labor market offers a unique opportunity to study how stable clearinghouses succeed and fail. To explore the reasons for the failure of the clearinghouse (and why failures of this kind of clearinghouse have been so rare), we conduct an experimental investigation of demand shocks of the kind that occurred in the gastroenterology market. We find that a reduction in demand for positions leads to the collapse of the match only when it is detectable by firms before being detected by workers (as in the unexpected shock that took place in 1996, which could be seen by firms in their reduced applicant pools). Simple demand and supply imbalances do not seem to interfere with the operation of the centralized match. Our results suggest an affirmative answer to the question posed by market participants about whether the clearinghouse could be successfully restarted, and that this would relieve some of the distress now reported in that market, by allowing it to operate later, at a more uniform time, and with more national scope.},

To support the debate over this issue, we synthesized public data on how services are provided to dual eligibles receiving covered benefits in both programs. Our analysis confirmed that most dual-eligible beneficiaries receive benefits separately for each program through fee-for-service arrangements. Their enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid managed care is growing but still low, with highly uneven experiences across states. Few states or health plans have experience with coordinating care for dual eligibles within an integrated plan. These findings reinforce the need for caution in considering policies that would rapidly give states the responsibility for coordinating dual eligibles' care and coverage. We also found data gaps that warrant prompt attention in order to provide national-level oversight and improve the evidence base for debating and tracking policy changes.},

The subject matter includes identification, data collection, and measurement problems. Four identification strategies are discussed, and five empirical examples - the effects of schooling, unions, immigration, military service, and class size - illustrate the methodological points. In discussing each example, we adopt an experimentalist perspective that emphasizes the distinction between variables that have causal effects, control variables, and outcome variables. The chapter also discusses secondary datasets, primary data collection strategies, and administrative data. The section on measurement issues focuses on recent empirical examples, presents a summary of empirical findings on the reliability of key labor market data, and briefly reviews the role of survey sampling weights and the allocation of missing values in empirical research. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Analyzing data from 40,916 physicians covered by a nationwide insurer, we found that the average physician spends 50.7 months-or almost 11 percent-of an assumed forty-year career with an unresolved, open malpractice claim. Although damages are a factor in how doctors perceive medical malpractice, even more distressing for the doctor and the patient may be the amount of time these claims take to be adjudicated. We conclude that this fact makes it important to assess malpractice reforms by how well they are able to reduce the time of malpractice litigation without undermining the needs of the affected patient.},

We contribute to this debate by measuring consumers' willingness to pay for fuel economy using a novel identification strategy and high quality microdata from wholesale used car auctions. We leverage differences in future fuel costs across otherwise identical vehicles that have different current mileage, and therefore different remaining lifetimes. By seeing how price differences across high and low mileage vehicles of different fuel economies change in response to shocks to the price of gasoline, we estimate the relationship between vehicle prices and future fuel costs. Our data suggest that used automobile prices move one for one with changes in present discounted future fuel costs, which implies that consumers fully value fuel economy.},

This study explores the association between socioeconomic status and the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory that is known to be affected by stress. We employ a voxel-based morphometry analytic framework with region of interest drawing for structural brain images acquired from participants across the socioeconomic spectrum (n = 317). Children from lower income backgrounds had lower hippocampal gray matter density, a measure of volume. This finding is discussed in terms of disparities in education and health that are observed across the socioeconomic spectrum.},

abstract = {In the United States, health care technology has contributed to rising survival rates, yet health care spending relative to GDP has also grown more rapidly than in any other country. We develop a model of patient demand and supplier behavior to explain these parallel trends in technology growth and cost growth. We show that health care productivity depends on the heterogeneity of treatment effects across patients, the shape of the health production function, and the cost structure of procedures such as MRIs with high fixed costs and low marginal costs. The model implies a typology of medical technology productivity: (I) highly cost-effective “home run” innovations with little chance of overuse, such as anti-retroviral therapy for HIV, (II) treatments highly effective for some but not for all (e.g., stents), and (III) “gray area” treatments with uncertain clinical value such as ICU days among chronically ill patients. Not surprisingly, countries adopting Category I and effective Category II treatments gain the greatest health improvements, while countries adopting ineffective Category II and Category III treatments experience the most rapid cost growth. Ultimately, economic and political resistance in the United States to ever-rising tax rates will likely slow cost growth, with uncertain effects on technology growth. (JEL H51, I11, I18, O31)},

abstract = {R. A. Fisher's classic text on the design of experiments is the principal source of inspiration for a model of data interpretation that is usually characterized as randomization analysis. In Chapter III of this text, Fisher briefly commented on how to make a randomization test on some data generated by a Darwin experiment. Two variants of this randomization test are discussed in this article. The variant that is discussed in Section 4 may be regarded as the forerunner of all nonparametric tests. The original variant of the test is discussed in Section 6. The author concludes that the Fisher randomization test is not logically viable.

@article{Brown2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: We estimate the incremental hospital resource consumption associated with treating selected complications experienced by Medicare beneficiaries undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

METHODS: This retrospective study, using the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file, identified 114,233 Medicare beneficiaries who survived CABG without concomitant valve repair during a hospitalization for fiscal year 2005. The frequencies of seven complications were determined: hemorrhage or postoperative shock, reoperation, postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome, new-onset hemodialysis, postoperative stroke, postoperative infection and septicemia. The observed and adjusted incremental hospital resources consumed (cost and length-of-stay) in treating beneficiaries experiencing each of the selected complications were estimated.

RESULTS: The mean cost of a hospitalization associated with a CABG procedure among Medicare beneficiaries was {\$}32,201 +/- {\$}23,059, and the mean length of stay was 9.9 +/- 7.8 days. After adjusting for patient demographics and comorbid conditions, the 13.64{\%} of Medicare beneficiaries experiencing any of the study complications consumed significantly more hospital resources (incremental cost, {\$}15,468) and had a longer length of stay (incremental stay, 5.3 days).

CONCLUSIONS: Despite ongoing improvements in outcomes, major complications remain common after bypass grafting and add substantially to hospital costs for these procedures. These findings suggest that the potential cost savings of redirecting resources currently spent on treating complications will help make the "business case" for investing in patient safety initiatives and best practices guidelines shown to reduce selected complications.},

abstract = {Medical bankruptcy, whatever its actual frequency, is an extreme example of a much broader phenomenon. Medical debt is surprisingly common, affecting about twenty-nine million nonelderly adult Americans, with and without health insurance. The presence of medical debt, even for the insured, appears to create health care access barriers akin to those faced by the uninsured. Policymakers, researchers, and medical providers should consider medical debt a risk factor for reduced health access and poorer health status. Simply reducing the number of uninsured Americans would be a hollow policy victory if the problems arising from medical debt persist.},
